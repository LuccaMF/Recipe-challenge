### What I learned

I had slight difficulties with the styling of the table.

However, with some research I managed to solve the spacing and change the color of the markers like this:

```css
table {
    border-collapse: separate;
    width: 100%;
}
td {
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
    border-bottom: 1px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2) solid;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Table Style](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table_style.asp) - This helped me to style the table. I really liked this pattern and it fit what I needed.
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me to organize and style the README.md.
