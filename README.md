### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
table {
    border-collapse: separate;
    width: 100%;
}
td {
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
    border-bottom: 1px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.2) solid;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me to organize and style the README.md.
